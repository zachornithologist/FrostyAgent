# My Reinforcement Learning Project

This project demonstrates a simple reinforcement learning agent using the Q-learning algorithm to play the FrozenLake game.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to run training and evaluation.
- `train.py`: Contains the training loop for the agent.
- `evaluate.py`: Script to evaluate the trained agent.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for hyperparameters and settings.
- `environments/`: Directory for custom environment setups.
- `agents/`: Directory for agent implementations.
- `utils/`: Directory for utility functions.
- `logs/`: Directory for saving logs and Q-table.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Instructions

1. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy gym matplotlib
    ```

2. Run the training script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

3. Evaluate the trained agent:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration

Adjust the hyperparameters in `config.py` as needed.
